### Waddup gitters ðŸ¤œðŸ¤› 

Firstly, Github needs to take a bow for its excellence and contribution. 
I have encountered GitHub so many times but I always ended up closing the window since I thought it is way out of my league 
BUT now I realized its importance genuinely and I'm up for gaining knowledge through your channel
       
#####  I'm newbies when it comes to writing code but I know the basics of programing and languages
###### Basic meant I know how the system works but I lack every skill to make a change in its components and workflows
#### I have concern about SECURITY both offline and online
### Needs a grip on LINUX based programs.
## Needs guidance and direction
